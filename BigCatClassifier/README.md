# Big Cat Classifier 

This is a part of a course I have been doing in the fastai framework. 
The work is very sloppy and messy, but I still managed to deploy it currently inside a python Tkinter app. 

Watch how it works here:

Its very very basic. Im still working on how to make the code better. But this being my first deployment of a Neural Network in Python, it goes here in the master. 

I haven't quite figured out how to have my model directly accessed from google drive by the program ive written, but Im working on it. Meanwhile , you an access the pkl (pickle) file for my model from the link below and insert local absolute file path in the variable 
#### model_path

Here is the link to my model:

The notebook where Ive trained the model is also included in this repo. I make changes to this file as I update the code.
