# Starter for deploying [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) models on [Render](https://render.com)

This repo was recommended to me by the fastai course as a part of the syllabus. We made our own projects and we were asked to make test pedictions and deploy them using Render. Although I haven't quite got to that part yet, I will though find different ways to deploy the model and attach it to this fork. I am very messy at organisation so will take some time and effort to make folders and readme markup files for each. If you are reading this in hopes of finding something please bear with me. 

Now the original for markup said this:


The sample app described here is up at https://fastai-v3.onrender.com. Test it out with bear images!

You can test your changes locally by installing Docker and using the following command:

```
docker build -t fastai-v3 . && docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 fastai-v3
```

The guide for production deployment to Render is at https://course.fast.ai/deployment_render.html.

Please use [Render's fast.ai forum thread](https://forums.fast.ai/t/deployment-platform-render/33953) for questions and support.
